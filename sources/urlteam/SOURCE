URLTeam [desc] is a group that bruteforces short urls (bit.ly, tinyurl 
etc) and share the resulting data in an attempt to prevent link 
rot[linkrot] should the shortener-services be shut down.

Getting the data:

Since 2014-11-06-20 or sometime before the data is avalible in 
incremental torrents (aka "Tinytown"). Torrents from 2014-11-06-20
and onwards may be found at archive.org with the search 
"subject:terroroftinytown", see [archivetorrents]. 
A non-complete text version of this search is avaliable at [mtorrents]. 

All torrents appear to be avaliable in the same form, i.e.

https://archive.org/download/urlteam_2014-11-06-20-33-23/urlteam_2014-
11-06-20-33-23_archive.torrent

for the date 2014-11-06 search match with the name 
"URLTeam Release 2014-11-06-20-33-23"

Data before 2014-11-06-20:
It is assumed that any data before this date in contained in 
[latestlarge]. A user on #urlteam did concurr with this
assumption.
